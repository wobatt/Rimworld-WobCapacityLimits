This mod allows you to change the carrying capacity of pawns and transports, as well as maximum stack sizes of most items.

The capacities and stack limits are changed in the mod's settings menu.

&lt;i&gt;Requires HugsLib.&lt;/i&gt;

-----

&lt;b&gt;Pawn Carry Capacity&lt;/b&gt;

Rimworld uses a simple calculation for how much stuff a pawn can carry
body size  35 = capacity in kg

This mod allows you to change that 35 to any number via the options menu.

Note that this is only for the inventory and caravans - in your base your pawns will still only carry one stack of items.

-----

&lt;b&gt;Transport Pods&lt;/b&gt;

The maximum transportable mass per pod can be edited via the options menu.

The amount of chemfuel a pod consumes per tile traveled can also be edited via the options menu, which will affect the maximum range of pods.

-----

&lt;b&gt;Stack Sizes&lt;/b&gt;

Each category of itemresource has a multiplier in the options menu. Each itemresource definition has its stack limit multiplied by this to get the new stack limit.

The maximum size of stack that a pawn can carry will be automatically set to the new maximum stack size.

-----

&lt;b&gt;Credits&lt;/b&gt;

This mod uses HugsLib and Harmony.
